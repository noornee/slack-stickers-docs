## ðŸŽ¯ Why We Built This  

Because words are hard and emojis just donâ€™t cut it sometimes. We realized Slack needed an easy way to send stickers, GIFs, and all things expressiveâ€”so we built it. Now you can add an extra layer of fun to your team chats, roast your coworkers with style, and react in ways words simply canâ€™t express. ðŸ¤©

Slack is a work tool, but that doesnâ€™t mean it should be all work and no play. We wanted to give teams a way to bond, express themselves, and make every message more engaging. Whether you're dropping a hilarious reaction in a meeting chat, throwing some shade at your office bestie, or celebrating a win, SlackStickers makes it all more fun. ðŸŽŠ

Plus, we just love stickers. Who doesnâ€™t? Stickers are a universal language of expression, and now, theyâ€™re at your fingertips in Slack! ðŸš€ðŸ’¡ðŸŽ¯
