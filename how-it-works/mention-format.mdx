### Using Mentions

You can also search for GIFs by **mentioning** the bot in Slack.

## How to Use

- `@Stickers for Slack search <search param>`
- `@Stickers for Slack find <search param>`
- `@Stickers for Slack gif <search param>`
- `@Stickers for Slack g <search param>`


For example, if you want to find a GIF of a happy dance, you can type:
```
@Stickers For Slack gif happy dance
```
This will return a preview of a matching GIF, with options to shuffle or send it.
