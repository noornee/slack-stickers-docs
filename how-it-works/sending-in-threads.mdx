### Sending GIFs in Threads

Due to Slack's design, ⚠️**slash commands do not work in threads**. To share a GIF in a thread, use one of the supported mention formats:

- `@sticker search <search param>`
- `@sticker find <search param>`
- `@sticker gif <search param>`
- `@sticker g <search param>`

This ensures you can still search for and send GIFs in threaded conversations.
