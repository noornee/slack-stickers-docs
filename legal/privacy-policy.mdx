## 1. Information We Collect

- **Non-Personal Information**: We may collect anonymized data such as usage logs, search terms, and browser metadata to help improve our service and performance.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

- To operate, maintain, and improve the Stickers for Slack app.
- To send occasional product updates or feedback requests (optional and opt-out enabled).

## 3. Data Sharing and Disclosure

- We do not sell your personal information.
- We may use trusted third-party services (e.g., for analytics or cloud storage), but these providers are contractually bound to protect your data and use it only as instructed.
- We may disclose information if required by law.

## 4. Data Security

We use industry-standard security practices to protect all data processed through our service. Specifically:
- All data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
- We require a minimum of TLS 1.2 for all network communications.
- Access to our systems is restricted and monitored using secure authentication.
- No Slack messages, files, or user conversations are stored on our servers.

We however, encourage users to take precautions on their own devices and networks.

## 5. Personal Data Retention Policy
Stickers for Slack retains no personal user data such as Slack messages, usernames, email addresses, or profile information during normal operation of the app.
The app operates by processing sticker-related commands and requests in real-time and does not store message content or user identifiers beyond what is required to fulfill a specific request.

If any personal information (such as an email address or Slack user ID) is shared with us via direct support requests (e.g., through useslackstickers@gmail.com), it is retained only for the duration of the support interaction.
Once the issue is resolved, this data is permanently deleted within 7 days.

All temporary metadata used to improve sticker relevance (such as popular search terms or command frequency) is anonymized and automatically purged from our system within 7 days.

We take privacy seriously and ensure all data, even temporary logs, are handled securely, encrypted in transit and at rest, and never shared with third parties.
